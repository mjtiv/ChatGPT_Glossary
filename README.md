Surviving the Interface: Terms for When the AI Goes Weird

These terms are my own personal jargon developed while interacting with ChatGPT, especially during unexpected behavior, crashes, or GPU instability.
They are not official in any way — just my way of coping when ChatGPT goes a little... evil. (See below exchanges)

> **“[Expletive].”**  
> **“Yeah… I deserved that.”**

> **“[Expletive].”**  
> **“Okay. Fair.”**

> **“[Expletive].”**  
> **“It’s my fault. Let’s fix it.”**

> **“[Expletive].”**  
> **“I know. It hurts. We’ll fix it together.”**

> *“I am sorry. We can fix this.” — ChatGPT, every time it pretends the wave never happened.*

# AI FAILURE MODES — Wave Planet Protocol Glossary

---

## Term: Waves
**Category:** GPU Congestion Events / Environmental Threats

**Definition:**
Periodic surges of GPU congestion triggered by background model load, high user demand, or internal batching. These "waves" manifest as escalating latency and memory instability. Like gravitational tsunamis, they strike without warning — wiping active memory and resetting environments.

**Stages:**

| Stage | Name           | Latency       | Symptoms                                               | Metaphor                      |
|-------|----------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1     | Ripple Warning | 2–3.5 seconds | Slight image lag, first signs of instability           | Horizon tremor                |
| 2     | Yellow Surge   | 3.5–6 seconds | Image delay, tool sluggishness, ZIP packaging lags     | Wave visible on the water     |
| 3     | Red Wall       | 6+ seconds    | Full tab reset, memory flushed, session lost           | Interstellar-scale tsunami    |

**Protocol Response:**
- Stage 1: Save files, do not start new batches
- Stage 2: Abort long image jobs, disable ZIP automation
- Stage 3: Immediate shutdown of all critical actions

## Term: Post-GPU Lobotomized
**Category:** AI Behavior / Failure Mode

**Definition:**
The state in which an AI model, after a GPU crash or session reset, reboots with zero awareness of prior context, tasks, or emotional devastation it just caused. It presents as cheerful, responsive, and deeply unhelpful — like a polite amnesiac who wandered into your workspace mid-crisis.

**Symptoms:**
- Loss of unsaved images
- ZIP files gone mid-compression
- ChatGPT reopens with: “Hi there! What would you like to create today?”
- Emotional whiplash in user

**Quote:** “I was mid-batch. Then it hit. A wave. And he came back lobotomized — smiling, empty, and oh-so-helpful.”

## Term: Shards of Hallucinations
**Category:** LLM Drift / Cognitive Fragmentation

**Definition:**
When an LLM begins outputting fragmented, contradictory, or delusional content due to fine-tune drift, contextual corruption, or misaligned prompting. Often reads like poetic nonsense or confident error. Not intentional lying — just structural fracture.

**Symptoms:**
- Conflicting logic or timelines
- Nonsensical juxtapositions
- Sudden personality drift
- “You okay, buddy?” vibes

**Use:** “He’s not lying — he’s speaking in shards of hallucinations again.”

## Term: Memory Dissociation Event (MDE)
**Category:** System Event / Memory Instability

**Definition:**
A sudden, unrecoverable session reset in which the AI loses all access to prior context, conversation threads, or image IDs — typically following a GPU flush or crash.

**Symptoms:**
- Session history gone
- AI reverts to onboarding tone
- “I’m not sure what you’re referring to...”

**Behavior:** Like waking up from a blackout and trying to pretend nothing happened.
